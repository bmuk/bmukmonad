title: About
---

I am a student studying computer science at Florida Polytechnic University in Lakeland, FL. I am very passionate about computer science, software design, future technology, cryptography, and the possibility of artificial intelligence. For the most part, my posts here will be scattered and disorganized as they will follow my interests. You can, however, expect the general theme to revolve around computer science, especially in regards to functional programming, cryptography/cyber security, or artificial intelligence. If there are any specific topics you would enjoy reading about, shoot me an email (britt.mathis@gmail.com) and I will consider posting about it.
